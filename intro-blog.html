<h1 id="toc_0">Couchbase .NET Client SDK Tutorial</h1>

<p>If you&#39;re an existing .NET Developer but new to Couchbase, this tutorial is for you!</p>

<p>With this tutorial we aim to help you understand what Couchbase Server is and how to use it from .NET in a step by step guide! The source code is available for each step as well as a detailed description for every task. </p>

<p>The tutorial bridges the gap between simple and advanced Couchbase concepts by walking through a complete web application (build in ASP.NET Web API 2.0) that uses the Couchbase .NET client library to connect to Couchbase Server. We also cover using N1QL and key-value set/get operations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Install and configure the Couchbase .NET Client</li>
<li>Bootstrap the .NET Client</li>
<li>Use LINQ with N1QL</li>
